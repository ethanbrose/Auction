AUCTION DESIGN

• When a user decides to auction off an item, they must choose a starting price, a set time for how long they would like their item to be up for sale, and a buy now price
• If the seller wants, they can add a 150 char description of the item
• When the auction gets to the final 10 minutes, a one minute extension is added for every new bid.
• In order to list an item, a small fee must be made.
• The highest bid will be listed under the item along with the remaining time, buy now price, and seller information
• Bidders can also pull their bid at any moment, and the previous highest bid will then be listed.
• instead of selecting a new price, bidders can "quick bid" which will place an offer 5% larger than the previous bid
• if a bidder makes an offer that is 20% larger than the previous bid, a confirmation will have to be made (this will prevent bidders from unintentionally bidding more than they would like)
• If at the end of the time, no one has placed on the item, the item will be taken off the market and returned to the seller.
• A buyer can also make an offer to the seller. If the seller accepts their offer the item will be sold to them. (OMITTED)
• If a seller knows they will not negotiate, they can click a button which will not allow any offers to be made to them. (OMITTED)
